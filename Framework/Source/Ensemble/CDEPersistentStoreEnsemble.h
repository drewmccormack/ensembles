/**
 Supply global identifiers for objects.
 
 By default, the ensemble will generate random global identifiers for all objects. If logically-equivalent objects are inserted on multiple devices, after merging, there will be duplicates.
 
 You can either deduplicate these objects in code, by fetching, and deleting a duplicate, or you can instead provide global identifiers which Ensembles can use to identify corresponding objects and merge them automatically.
 
 Whenever the ensemble needs to know the global identifier of one or more objects, it will invoke this method. You can determine the identifiers as you please, but they must be immutable: an object should not have its global identifier change at any point. If you find you are tempted to change the global identifier of an object, it is better to delete the object instead, and create a new object with the new identifier.
 
 The global identifiers do not have to be stored in the persistent store, but it often works out to be the best solution. You can either determine the global identifier from existing properties (eg email, tag), or store a random identifier like a uuid.
 
 If you have certain objects in the array for which you do not wish to assign your own global identifier, you can return `NSNull` in that position.
 
 @param ensemble The ensemble requesting global identifiers
 @param objects The objects for which global identifiers are requested
 @return An array of global identifiers for the objects passed, in the same order. `NSNull` can be inserted in this array where no global identifier is needed.

/**
 The central class of Ensembles, it represents a set of synchronizing persistent stores.
 
 An ensemble can be seen as a set of persistent stores that exchange data in order to reach eventual consistency. The `CDEPersistentStoreEnsemble` class is responsible for monitoring saves to a persistent store, exchanging this data with ensemble objects on other peers, and merging changes from other peers into its persistent store.
 
 You typically create one `CDEPersistentStoreEnsemble` object for each persistent store that you need to sync in your app. An ensemble has an identifier, which is used to match it with other ensemble objects on peer devices. Ensemble objects with the same identifier are considered to represent corresponding persistent stores, and the data in the persistent stores will be merged.
 
 The process of initially setting up an ensemble object for communication with its peers is known as 'leeching'. An ensemble begins in a deleeched state. Leeching prepares local storage needed by the framework, registers the device in the cloud, and migrates the data in the local persistent store into the cloud. Leeching is persistent, and typically only need be performed once, though it is possible to request that the ensemble deleech.
 
 Once an ensemble is leeched, it can merge changes from other devices. Merging involves replaying changes from other devices, together with locally recorded changes, in order to update the persistent store. If changes are made concurrently on different devices, there is no guarantee that the data will be valid after replaying the changes. The ensemble provides delegate methods that can be used to make repairs to the data before committing. The changes made in reparation are also captured by the ensemble and transferred to other peers.
